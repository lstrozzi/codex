Instructions for maintaining these .html and .css files

# Structure

- The entry point of the html pages is "main.html".
- main.html includes (with javascript) other pages, which may optionally include other pages recursively
- the site.css file defines styles for the whole site

# Structured data and metadata
- Data and Metadata structures are defined by using custom Html elements:
 -- <div>The content and its title and metadata must be encapsulated in divs</div>
 -- <Content>This element contains the main content of a div</Content>
 -- <Metadata>This element contains metadata, structured in sub-elements</Metadata>

# Styles
- The styles defined in styles.css are mostly defining how html elements have to be rendered.
- The css classes are used not at all, or sporadingly for ad-hoc styling
- For each structured custom element, such as Content, Metadata, ..., there must be a defined CSS styles
