    <title>Description of Peter the Fisherman's house</title>
    <content>
        <p>Pete's house stands atop a windswept bluff overlooking the harbor, its weather-beaten shutters framing the ever-changing sea beyond. The exterior walls, constructed from hand-hewn driftwood planks, bear the silvered patina of countless storms and sunlit afternoons.</p>
        <p>Inside, the main room centers around a broad stone hearth, where a steady glow of embers offers warmth against the ocean chill. Sturdy wooden beams support the low ceiling, and rough-hewn furniture, crafted by Pete himself, adorns the space, each scratched surface telling stories of long nights spent mending nets and charting tides.</p>
        <p>The modest kitchen nook features a well-worn oak table scarred by years of fish scales and saltwater. Copper pots hang from wrought-iron hooks, and jars of dried herbs line a narrow shelf above the single-pane window that peers out onto the rocky cove below.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, two small chambers are separated by a low door; one serves as Pete's sleeping quarters, its straw-filled mattress nestled beneath a slanted roof, while the other houses his maps and trinkets, laid out on a small writing desk illuminated by a single lantern.</p>
        <p>Outside, a narrow path leads around the cottage to a humble boathouse where Pete's lean skiff rests on wooden stilts. A tangle of fishing lines and nets hangs from pegs along the wall, and a scattering of wildflowers clings to the rocky soil, their delicate blooms providing a quiet contrast to the house's rugged charm.</p>
